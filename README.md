# API Gateways

Getting started with API Gateways (AWS first)

## Motivation

Following the [Single responsibility principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
(which is the S in SOLID) and likewise [Separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns),
decoupling application logic from plumbing is probably a serverless ___best practice___.

API gateways can be used for:

* Filtering input data based on request and response mapping models
* Decoupling authorization and authentication from business logic
* Traffic throttling and rate limiting
* DDOS protection
